### Talk title:
Elixir in the Medical Cannabis industry

### Talk abstract:
Weedmaps is the largest technology company in the Marijuana industry. We currently have 10,000 clients, across 28 states in 4 countries and handle 8.5m page views a month.
We experienced explosive growth from 2013 through now as more states legalized the medicinal use of cannabis. On 4/20 2016 - the "Black Friday of Weed" - that growth reached
a critical mass and we suffered a catastrophic outage. This outage, the resulting loss of revenue and the projected growth of cannabis legalization in the US led us to reconsider
how long the Rails monolith could support our growth.

This talk chronicles the architectural journey over the last year as our application architecture evolved from a Rails monolith to a NodeJS microservice architecture and finally to a platform of services
written in Elixir. It covers the architectural decisions that were made in the short, medium and long term and how 5 architects all came to the same conclusion through very different paths.  If we wanted to continue to support
our extreme growth in user base, while adding new features and expanding into new markets we needed an architecture that gives us flexibility, low latency, redundancy, scalability without the limits
of a monolith and the technical complexity of microservices. We needed Elixir.

### Talk TLDR:
This talk covers the decisions that led the architecture team at Weedmaps to select Elixir as the language to use as we continue to grow with the exploding Cannabis industry.

### Target audience:
Software architecture teams that are facing the same operational challenges and architectural decisions presented by monolithic application as they try to expand or are interested in introducing Elixir to their software architecture.
